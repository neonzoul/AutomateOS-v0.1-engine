### **AutomateOS Engine: A lightweight, plugin-driven workflow engine. Built to be extended.**

A clear separation of concerns is at the heart of this design. With distinct layers for the API, engine, database models, and schemas, the codebase is crafted to be easy to understand, maintain, and contribute to.

At its core, the engine is a lean **Orchestrator** designed to dynamically load and run any node, providing maximum flexibility to build the automations.
